# Notework
Single page application version of the cheat sheet project

## Background
This was my first ever web development project. I build the whole thing using 
just HTML, CSS, and JS. To bundle the modules, however, I thought I'd be "smart"
and used this nifty new bundler called Snowpack that barely understood. Still, 
the end result is pretty cool. Clone it and take a look!

## Technologies
1. Vanilla JS
2. Snowpack

## To install and run
1. Clone repo
2. npm i
3. Get HTTPS certificate
    a. npx devcert-cli generate localhost (and follow instructions)
    b. Change the names of the files generated to snowpack.crt and snowpack.key
4. npm run snowpack
